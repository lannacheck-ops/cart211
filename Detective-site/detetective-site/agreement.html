                <h2>OmniCore — Terms & Conditions</h2>
                <h3>1. Introduction to Our Experience Framework</h3>
                <p>
                    At OmniCore, your comfort is our priority. Every interaction you make — from tapping a button to
                    navigating a page —
                    generates Experience Optimization Signals that help us understand how to design smoother, more
                    intuitive
                    journeys for
                    you. These signals are a natural byproduct of using our Services and are essential to maintaining
                    platform integrity and
                    user satisfaction.

                    We are committed to using these signals solely to enhance your interaction, refine our systems, and
                    develop new features
                    that anticipate your needs before you even express them.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
                <h4>2.1. Voluntary Inputs</h4>
                <p>
                    Information you choose to provide, such as profile details, preferences, and communication settings.
                    These details enable us to personalize your workspace and reduce unnecessary friction.
                </p>
                <h4>2.2. Automated System Outputs</h4>
                <p>
                    As part of routine service functioning, our systems generate <span class="euphemisms">Service
                        Enhancement Metrics</span>, which help
                    us identify trends and user patterns that support platform improvement. These metrics are
                    aggregated, anonymized where appropriate, and analyzed to maintain platform health.
                </p>
                <h4>2.3. User Interaction Derivatives (UIDs)</h4>
                <p>
                    During normal use, small fragments of interaction data — sometimes referred to as <span
                        class="euphemisms">behavioral residues</span> — may be produced. UIDs support our predictive
                    modeling capabilities, enabling
                    us to
                    proactively protect your account and streamline your overall experience.
                </p>
                <h4>2.4. Ambient Technical Footprints</h4>
                <p>
                    Your use of our Services may create what the industry commonly calls <span class="euphemisms">data
                        exhaust</span>. This includes
                    device identifiers, session timestamps, navigation sequences, and general system diagnostics. These
                    footprints help us ensure the platform operates efficiently and remains fully responsive to your
                    needs.
                </p>
                <h3>3. Your Privacy with OmniCore</h3>
                <p>
                    Your privacy <span class="euphemisms">remains with us</span>. OmniCore adheres to industry-leading
                    safeguards designed to protect
                    your information while
                    allowing us to transform it into meaningful improvements. We ensure that all Experience Optimization
                    Signals and Ambient
                    Technical Footprints are processed securely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may choose to adjust certain privacy settings within your account dashboard. However, disabling
                    core data captures
                    may limit OmniCore’s ability to provide an optimized, fully personalized experience.
                </p>
