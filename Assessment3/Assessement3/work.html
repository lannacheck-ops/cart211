                In 2016, Ocean Vuong published his first full-length poetry collection, Night Sky with Exit Wounds,
                released by Copper
                Canyon Press. The book was widely acclaimed for its lyrical intensity and exploration of war, exile, and
                queer identity.
                It won several prestigious awards, including the T. S. Eliot Prize, the Whiting Award, and the Forward
                Prize for Best
                First Collection, quickly establishing him as one of the most important new voices in contemporary
                poetry.

                The success of Night Sky with Exit Wounds led to invitations for public readings at universities,
                literary festivals,
                and cultural institutions around the world. Unlike the underground circuits of earlier generations of
                poets, Vuong’s
                performances were marked by a quiet, reflective delivery that contrasted with the raw urgency of his
                themes. These
                readings brought his work to broader audiences and solidified his reputation as both a poet and cultural
                figure engaged
                in questions of memory, migration, and belonging.
