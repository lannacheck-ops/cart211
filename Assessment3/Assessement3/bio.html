            <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
            <p>
                After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family marked by the experiences
                of war and
                exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former rice farmer, profoundly
                shaped his
                imagination and relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his family to learn how to read and
                write.
                He studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in English from Brooklyn
                College, followed by
                an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.
            </p>
            <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>
            <p>
                His first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with the collection Night Sky with Exit
                Wounds (2016)
                that he gained international recognition. His poetry explores themes of the Vietnam War’s legacy,
                migration, queer
                identity, and the fragility of language.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, he published his debut novel, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, widely acclaimed by critics.
                Written as a letter
                to his illiterate mother, the book intertwines autobiography, family history, and reflections on
                sexuality, race, and
                inherited trauma.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2022, he released Time Is a Mother, a poetry collection shaped by mourning his mother’s death and an
                even more
                intimate exploration of grief and survival.
            </p>
            <p>
